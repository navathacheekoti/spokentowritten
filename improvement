I have not have taken care of punctuation rules in the previous part of the exercise.
Can you design in a way that such rules can be easily added without having to re-test all the previous rule implementations?
I can design the rules it takes a lot of time to design such kind of things .
If i added the rules I have to test all without testing I don't know how to add such kind of rules.
Due to time constrain and I ahve 3 more sections to do thats why I am not adding any code to the punctiation marks and other things In the above code I added for 
def get_rules():
    rules = {"Numbers":{
                        "zero": 0,
                        "one" : 1,
                        "two": 2,
                        "three": 3,
                        "four": 4,
                        "five": 5,
                        "six": 6,
                        "seven": 7,
                        "eight": 8,
                        "nine": 9,
                        "ten": 10,
                        "twenty": 20,
                        "thirty": 30,
                        "forty": 40,
                        "fifty": 50,
                        "sixty": 60,
                        "seventy": 70,
                        "eighty": 80,
                        "ninety": 90,
                        "hundred": 100
                        },
            "Tuples": {
                         "single":1,
                         "double":2,
                         "triple":3,
                         "quadruple":4,
                         "quintuple":5,
                         "sextuple":6,
                         "septuple":7,
                         "octuple":8,
                         "nonuple":9,
                         "decuple":10
                      },
            "General": {
                          "C M": "CM",
                          "P M": "PM",
                          "D M": "DM",
                          "A M": "AM"
                       }
            }
    return rules

Remaining rules I will add If you give me time and I have test atleast some not each one but one time I need to test them.
Thank you.
